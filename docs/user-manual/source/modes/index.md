# Main Modes

The PGB-1 interface operates in four main modes, plus a special Sample Mode. Each mode affects what is displayed on screen, how the keyboard LEDs behave, and the function of the buttons.

## Overview

| Mode | Button | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Track Mode | {kbd}`Track` | Configure instrument sounds and settings |
| Step Mode | {kbd}`Step` | Configure individual step parameters |
| Pattern Mode | {kbd}`Pattern` | Configure pattern length and linking |
| Song Mode | {kbd}`Song` | Arrange song parts and chord progressions |
| Sample Mode | Hold {kbd}`Cpy/FX` + {kbd}`Edit` | Create and edit samples |

## Switching Modes

To enter a mode, press and release the corresponding mode button. The LED next to the button will light up to indicate the active mode.

## Quick Selection

You can select items without changing modes by holding the mode button:

- **Hold** {kbd}`Track` + press {kbd}`1`-{kbd}`16` to select a track
- **Hold** {kbd}`Step` + press {kbd}`1`-{kbd}`16` to select a step
- **Hold** {kbd}`Pattern` + press {kbd}`1`-{kbd}`16` to select a pattern
- **Hold** {kbd}`Song` + press {kbd}`1`-{kbd}`12` to select a song part

This is useful when you want to change what you're working on while staying in your current mode.
