:::{rubric} Demo Projects
:::

The PGB-1 comes with built-in demo projects to help you explore its capabilities:

- **"Lost1"** (Lost one) by [AA Battery Music](https://www.aabattery.de/)
- **"Noxis"** in collaboration with [Technoval](https://soundcloud.com/technoval)
- **"Dark (#1)"** based on [BroBeatzTV's dark trap tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdESI3Ds7LM)
- **"Echo (#2)"** based on [Alice Efe's downtempo tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zIsQfKtUno)

Load a demo project from the menu: {kbd}`Menu` > **Projects** > **Load**. Once the
project is loaded, you can press the {kbd}`Play` button to start the sequencer.
Most demo projects contain several "song parts", these are sections of a song
with different patterns, chords, or instruments enabled (intro, chorus, break,
outro, etc.).

To change the song part, press the {kbd}`Song` button to enter [Song
mode](modes/song-mode.md), then press button {kbd}`2` to queue part two. It can
take some time for the new part to start playing as the sequencer will wait for
the full run of the current part before switching to the new one. Get familiar
with each part and perform your own version of the track. You can also jump in
[Track mode](modes/track-mode.md) and tweak the synths parameters.
