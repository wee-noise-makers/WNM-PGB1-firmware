# Warranty & Support

## Warranty

Devices purchased directly from Wee Noise Makers have a warranty of six months
from the date of purchase. This warranty can be extended depending on local
regulations.

This warranty covers any manufacturing defects in the device. It
does not cover damage due to incorrect handling, storage, power, overvoltage
events, or modifications.

Please use the [Contact Form](https://weenoisemakers.com/contact) on our
website if you are experiencing issues with your device. Devices returned under
warranty will either be refunded, re- placed, or repaired at our discretion.
User data may not be preserved. You will be responsible for the cost of
returning the device to Wee Noise Makers.

## Modding and Hacking

PGB-1 is open source and designed to be extended and modified by users.
However, hardware modification or installation of third party firmware can lead
to irreversible damage to the device. Wee Noise Makers will not be accountable
for those damages. Any modification will void the warranty, and could void the
user's authority to operate the equipment. We will not refund, repair, or
replace any products that have been modified.
