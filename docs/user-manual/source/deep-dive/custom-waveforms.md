# Custom Waveforms

*Available from firmware 1.2.0*

The PGB-1 allows you to draw and edit custom single-cycle waveforms that can be used with various synth engines.

## Accessing Custom Waveform Editor

1. Press {kbd}`Menu`
2. Navigate right to **Custom Waveform**
3. Press {kbd}`A` to enter

## Editor Options

### Draw Your Own

Edit the waveform manually:

- Use {kbd}`←` / {kbd}`→` to move the cursor horizontally
- Use {kbd}`↑` / {kbd}`↓` to adjust the waveform value at that point
- Use the **touch strip** to set the value directly
- Hold {kbd}`←` while moving the touch strip to draw continuously

### Load Preset

Load from built-in waveform presets:

1. Navigate to the **Load** option
2. Use {kbd}`↑` / {kbd}`↓` to browse presets
3. Press {kbd}`A` to load

Available presets include various classic waveform shapes that serve as starting points for your designs.

## Using Custom Waveforms

Custom waveforms are available in specific synth engines. Look for engines with "Custom Waveform" in the name:

### Bass/Lead Engines

- Custom Waveform Glide
- Custom Waveform Phaser
- Custom Waveform Pluck
- Custom Waveform Echo
- Custom Waveform PDR (Phase Distortion Resonance)

### Kick Engines

- Custom Waveform Kick
- Custom Click Kick (custom waveform with click)

### Chord Engines

- Custom Waveform (4-voice polyphonic using custom waveform)

## Live Editing

One powerful feature is the ability to edit the waveform while playback is running:

1. Start a sequence with a track using a custom waveform engine
2. Enter the Custom Waveform menu
3. Draw or load new waveforms
4. Changes take effect immediately

This enables real-time sound design during performance.

## Waveform Storage

- One custom waveform per project
- The waveform is saved with the project
- Different projects can have different custom waveforms

## Basic Shapes

- **Sine-like**: Smooth curves for soft, warm sounds
- **Square-like**: Flat tops/bottoms for hollow, reedy sounds
- **Sawtooth-like**: Diagonal slopes for bright, buzzy sounds
- **Triangle-like**: Symmetrical slopes for smooth, flute-like sounds

## Tips

- Use the touch strip for quick, expressive drawing
